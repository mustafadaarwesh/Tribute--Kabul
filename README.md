# Tribute--Kabul
I designed the webpage for readers and viewers to advise them about the beauty of Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.
Kabul, A city full my memories and it is one of the Ancient cities in the Southern Asia. 
Kabul has been the Capital of Afghanistan for over 3 centuries and it was the home of different empires. 
Kabul is the first city in the ASIA where all four seasons are good for people to cultivate and enjoy the beauty of its land.
